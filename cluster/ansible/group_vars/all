# ======================
# Configuration of a HBase Cluster
# ---
# The variable in this part can be changed to adapt the playbooks to your
# specific needs. Anything further down should only be changed if you really
# know what you are doing!
# ======================

# Setting this to true causes the entire cluster to be started in secure mode,
# all services will require a kerberos ticket to allow access and all http uis
# will only work over https. Please note: Since a new CA is generated for this
# example your browser will warn you about an insecure connection, as your
# browser will not trust this CA. To fix this you can either add an exception
# for these urls or import the rootCA.pem file from the
# cluster/ansible/files/tmp/certs folder relative to your repository root.
SECURITY_ENABLED: true

# If set to true all services will be restarted whenever a config file change
# that affects this service is made. TBD.
RESTART_ON_CHANGE: true

# This setting affects the fqdns that your hosts will get on the internal
# network that Vagrant (if used at all) creates. Hostnames will be
# "master-[1..x].CLUSTER_DOMAIN" and "worker-[1..y].CLUSTER_DOMAIN".
CLUSTER_DOMAIN: hbase.book

# This controls where the tarballs for the installation are retrieved from.
# Setting this to true means that every machine downloads the tarball from the
# internet - this is useful for EC2 instances for example. Setting this to
# false makes the playbook upload the tarballs to the remote machines from the
# machine that runs ansible. In this case you need to provide tarballs for the
# versions configured below in the files/downloads/ directory.
REMOTE_FETCH_TARBALLS: false
