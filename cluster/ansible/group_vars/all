# Setting this to true causes the entire cluster to be started in secure mode, all services will require a kerberos
# ticket to allow access and all http uis will only work over https
# Please note:
# Since a new CA is generated for this example your browser will warn you about an insecure connection, as your browser
# will not trust this CA. To fix this you can either add an exception for these urls or import the rootCA.pem file from
# the cluster/ansible/files/tmp/certs folder relative to your repository root.
SECURITY_ENABLED: false

# If set to true all services will be restarted whenever a config file change that affects this service is made.

# This setting affects the fqdns that your hosts will get on the internal network that Vagrant creates.
